> ### [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](http://realworld-nuxt.netlify.com)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org)** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
